🚑💉 New Tableau Dashboard: COVID-19 Analysis in India (2020) 📊

I'm thrilled to share my latest project—a Tableau dashboard that provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19's impact in India for the year 2020. This interactive dashboard highlights key metrics, including:

• Total affected individuals and regional case distribution • Vaccine administration rates and trends 💉 • Mortality and recovery ratios 📉 • Monthly progression analysis 🔍 • Geographical spread and hotspots 📍

The dashboard helps visualize critical insights into COVID-19 trends, vaccination progress, and high-risk areas, with filters, dropdowns, and export options for easy navigation and reporting. It’s designed to support healthcare professionals, policymakers, and stakeholders in making informed decisions.
